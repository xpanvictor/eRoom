<span class="s2">This is a grand overview of eClass. The project descriptions and user stories</span>
<span class="s2">will be documented here providing proof of concept and future back testing source.</span>
<span class="s2">This document will be reviewed and improved gradually even during development.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">What is eClass</span>

<span class="s2">eClass is a complete provisioning for virtual classrooms but more. It provides</span>
<span class="s2">all user required features for ensuring the classroom is reachable and usable</span>
<span class="s2">within the comfort of the students and the teachers.   </span>
<span class="s2">With support for all things the physical classroom can provide, it bridges the</span>
<span class="s2">gap between the teacher and the students while ensuring that each student gets the most</span>
<span class="s2">of the classroom.   </span>
<span class="s2">It also provides personal support to the users making it more than an academic forum but</span>
<span class="s2">also a social media. This ensures to provide the complete environment for a successful </span>
<span class="s2">academic session.    </span>
