## What is eClass

eClass is a complete provisioning for virtual classrooms but more. It provides
all user required features for ensuring the classroom is reachable and usable
within the comfort of the students and the teachers.   
With support for all things the physical classroom can provide, it bridges the
gap between the teacher and the students while ensuring that each student gets the most
of the classroom.   
It also provides personal support to the users making it more than an academic forum but
also a social media. This ensures to provide the complete environment for a successful 
academic session.
